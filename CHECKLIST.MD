* **🎤 Get a wearable microphone:** Having your speaker write code and hold the microphone at the same time is tricky. Do your best to get a microphone that can be wore

* **🤓 Validate your speaker's slides:** Not all experts know how to share their knowledge. Ask your speakers to submit their presentations before the event. Speakers must submit ther presentation online, as well as the code they are pretending to show (CodePen, JSFiddler, Stackblitz or Plunker), so everything can be screened from the same laptop

### Workshops (For VIP Workshops only)

* 💾 For practical exercises explain in great detail what tools need to be installed beforehand
* 📁 Create a document with environmental setup so all (not really, but at least most) of the attendees come with all the tools installed and ready
* 🤳 Test your workshop the same week of the event, that way you can reduce the chances of something failing due to some dependency update.

* 👴 Prepare your workshop with someone who doesn't know anything about the topic, that way can validate the way your workshop is given.
* 📦 Create a repository that holds all the code that will be written during the workshop. Creating branches to denote every step makes it easier for the attendees to fully understand the differences between steps. Use numbers to name the branches.
* 📝 Put every step of the process in the slides, that's easier for people to follow.
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Ask members of the community for help prior to the workshop. The should serve as assistants when any of the attendees is stuck in the process. They should be contacted at least two weeks before the event, so they can study the contents and be ready to help
* 🔌 If you are running a workshop make sure that you have enough power outlets for most of the members of the meetup
