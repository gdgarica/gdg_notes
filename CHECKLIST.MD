## Cada día/cada dos días

* **👀 Comprobar la actividad de todos los problemas sin resolver:** Make sure there are no blockers and all of them are updated.
* **🤳 Revisar Slack:** Responder comentarios o preguntas de la comunidad.
* **👮 Comprobar el progreso de las charlas:** Recordar a los oradores que envíen las diapositivas y completen cualquier otra información faltante.

## Antes del evento

### General

* **📆 Seleccionar una fecha:** Asegurarse que no haya otros eventos en paralelo (como la final de la UEFA Champions League 😅).
* **🏢 Reservar el lugar:** Asegurarse que los patrocinadores tengan el lugar preparado y reservado.
* **🎁 Conseguir SWAG:** Pedirle a tu patrocinador de SWAG regalos para tu próximo meetup.
* **📝 Información del evento:** Incluya esta información en la descripción de su evento para el meetup.
    * **🏢 Ubicación específica:** La dirección, un Google Maps, el nombre del lugar y las indicaciones de cómo llegar son importantes.
    * **📚 Lecturas opcionales:** Pequeños artículos o videos de Youtube que sirvan de introducción a los temas que expondran los oradores.
    * **🚲 Estacionamiento:** Hacer saber a los asistentes si el lugar ofrece estacionamiento o lugares para dejar sus bicicletas.

### Logística

* **🏢 Visitar el lugar antes del evento:** Asegurarse de que todo funciona y se ajusta a las necesidades del evento.
* **🔧 Comprender aspectos técnicos de su auditorio:** Ask if you will have a technical assistant during the event, otherwise make sure you know how to handle all the technical difficulties you may encounter (wifi, sound, amplification, AC, projection, lights, microphone, keys to open the room, etc)
* **🎤 Get a wearable microphone:** Having your speaker write code and hold the microphone at the same time is tricky. Do your best to get a microphone that can be wore
* **🕴 Conseguir suficientes sillas:** Make sure you have plenty of chairs, you don't want to have people standing during your event
* **🍪 Tener un lugar para los snacks:** You will need a table, a few garbage cans and enough space for people to spare
* **🔌 Enchufes de Corriente:** Make sure there are enough power outlets near the stage, otherwise get an extension to be able to plug the presenter's laptop
* **📺 Puertos de Proyección:** Ask your speaker about technical requirements, hopefully VGA and HDMI should be enough, otherwise find a way to get the proper converter

### Charlas

* **🤓 Validate your speaker's slides:** Not all experts know how to share their knowledge. Ask your speakers to submit their presentations before the event. Speakers must submit ther presentation online, as well as the code they are pretending to show (CodePen, JSFiddler, Stackblitz or Plunker), so everything can be screened from the same laptop
* **👄 Support other languages if applies:** Make room for a 10 minute talk in another language to motivate the community to learn and practice
* **♿️ Hacer que sus contenidos sean accesibles:** Make sure sure all the contents of the next meetup are accessible for people with disabilities
* **🤵 Encontrar un speaker internacional:** Have someone from another country to speak for 10-15 minutes in a Hangout
* **⏰ Non-practical talks should be short:** Talks with no practical content can make people get bored, make sure those are short (up to 30 minutes).

### Workshops (For VIP Workshops only)

* 💾 For practical exercises explain in great detail what tools need to be installed beforehand
* 📁 Create a document with environmental setup so all (not really, but at least most) of the attendees come with all the tools installed and ready
* 🤳 Test your workshop the same week of the event, that way you can reduce the chances of something failing due to some dependency update.
* 💾 Test your workshop on different Operative Systems, that way you know what to do when they find a OS stopper.
* 👴 Prepare your workshop with someone who doesn't know anything about the topic, that way can validate the way your workshop is given.
* 📦 Create a repository that holds all the code that will be written during the workshop. Creating branches to denote every step makes it easier for the attendees to fully understand the differences between steps. Use numbers to name the branches.
* 📝 Put every step of the process in the slides, that's easier for people to follow.
* 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Ask members of the community for help prior to the workshop. The should serve as assistants when any of the attendees is stuck in the process. They should be contacted at least two weeks before the event, so they can study the contents and be ready to help
* 🔌 If you are running a workshop make sure that you have enough power outlets for most of the members of the meetup

## Durante el evento

### Registro Visual

* **🤳 Ask someone professionally to take photos:** Photos are a great way to attract new members to participate, so make sure you take enough photos during the event. 🎥 Video is also a great resource.

### Secciones de Presentación
